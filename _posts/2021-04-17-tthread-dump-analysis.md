excerpt: "Thread dump is a snapshot of the states of all the threads in an application. They are useful to identify the root cause of various problems transpiring in applications running in live systems. In this post, we will look at the contents of a thread dump, different means of generating thread dumps, and analyzing them to identify the potential causes of a problem."

A thread is a basic path of execution in a program.  Most of the applications we build today execute in a multi-threaded environment. As such a program running perfectly in the development environment may encounter thread-related issues when promoted to higher environments where it is serving multiple concurrent requests. A program becomes unresponsive if the thread executing at that point of time is stuck due to various reasons. 

A thread dump provides a snapshot of all the threads in a program executing at a specific instant. Some of the threads belong to our Java application being run while the remaining are JVM internal threads. The state of each thread is followed by a stack trace containing the information about the applicationâ€™s thread activity that can help us diagnose problems and optimize application and JVM performance;


For this reason, it is a vital tool for understanding issues related to application slowness, an application becoming unresponsive, or deadlock situations. 

In this post, we will look at different thread dumps and understanding the information they contain to diagnose application threading issues.

## Lifecycle States of a Thread

For understanding thread dump, it is essential to know all the states a thread passes through during its life cycle. A thread can assume one of these four states:

1. **New**: Initial state of a thread when we create an instance of `Thread` or `Runnable`. It remains in this state until the program starts the thread.

2. **Runnable**: After a new thread is started, the thread becomes runnable. A thread in this state is considered to be executing its task.

3. **Non-Runnable(Blocked, Waiting, or Timed Waiting)**: Sometimes, a thread transitions to the waiting state while waiting for another thread to perform a task. A thread transitions back to the runnable state only when another thread signals the waiting thread to continue executing.
A timed waiting state is a thread waiting for a specified interval of time and transitioning back to the runnable state when that time interval expires.

4. **Terminated (Dead)** A runnable thread enters the terminated state after it finishes its task.


## Generating a Thread Dump
We will now generate some thread dumps by running a simple java program. 

### Running an Example Program
We will capture the thread dump of an application that simulates a web server. The `main` method of our application looks like this:
```java
public class App {
  private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(App.class.getName());

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        ServerSocket ssock = new ServerSocket(8080);
        logger.info("Server Started. Listening on port 8080");
        
        while (true) {
           new RequestProcessor(ssock).handleClientRequest();;
        }   
  }
}
```
Here we instantiate a `ServerSocket` class that listens on port 8080 for incoming client requests and does some processing on the same `main` thread.

Let us build this program with Maven and then run this program as a java executable with the command:
```shell
java -jar target/ServerApp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
The Java application now listens for requests on port 8080 and responds with a JSON string on receiving HTTP GET requests on URL: http://localhost:8080/.

### Generating the Thread Dump
We will now generate the thread dump of the application that we started in the previous step by using a utility named `jcmd`. The [jcmd](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/troubleshoot/tooldescr006.html) utility is used to send diagnostic command requests to the Java Virtual Machine(JVM). 

For this, we will first find the process identifier(PID) of the application by running the `jps` command:
```shell
jps -l
```
Running the `jps` command gives the following output:
```shell
753 target/ServerApp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
754 jdk.jcmd/sun.tools.jps.Jps
```
Each line of the output contains the PID and the name of our class containing the `main` method.
Alternately, we can find the PID by running `ps -a` in Unix or Linux systems.

We will now generate the thread dump by running the `jcmd` command:

```shell
jcmd 753 Thread.print > threadDump.txt
```
The generated thread dump output is written to the `threadDump.txt` file. A snippet from the thread dump file is shown here:
```shell

```
We can see the `main` thread in the `RUNNABLE` state with a thread id(tid), cpu time, and priority. Each thread information is accompanied by its stack trace. The stack trace of the `main` thread shows the `handleClientRequest`of the `RequestProcessor` getting invoked from the `main` method in the last two lines. Apart from the `main` thread in the `RUNNABLE` state, we can see some threads in states `WAITING`, and `TIMED_WAITING`.

## Anatomy of a Thread Dump Entry
Let us now understand the fields present in each thread dump line by looking at an entry from a thread dump of a Kafka broker:
```shell
"main-EventThread" #20 daemon prio=5 os_prio=31 cpu=10.36ms elapsed=90.79s tid=0x00007fa0e021a800 nid=0x6503 waiting on condition  [0x0000700003098000]
   java.lang.Thread.State: WAITING (parking)
  at jdk.internal.misc.Unsafe.park(java.base@14.0.1/Native Method)
  - parking to wait for  <0x00000007c8103d70> (a java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer$ConditionObject)
  at java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport.park(java.base@14.0.1/LockSupport.java:341)
  at java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer$ConditionNode.block(java.base@14.0.1/AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.java:505)
  at java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.managedBlock(java.base@14.0.1/ForkJoinPool.java:3137)
  at java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer$ConditionObject.await(java.base@14.0.1/AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.java:1614)
  at java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingQueue.take(java.base@14.0.1/LinkedBlockingQueue.java:435)
  at org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxn$EventThread.run(ClientCnxn.java:506)
```
The thread dump entry shown here starts with the name of the thread `main-EventThread` which is the 20th thread(indicated by`#20`) created by the JVM after it started. The daemon keyword after the thread number indicates that this is a daemon thread, which means that it will not prevent the JVM from shutting down if it is the last running thread. Then there are less important pieces of metadata about the thread, like a priority, os priority, thread identifier, and native identifier. The last pieces of information are the most important the state of the thread and its address in the JVM. The thread can be in one of the four states as explained earlier.


## Taking a Thread Dump
There are various methods of taking the thread dump. We used JDK's `jcmd` utility in the previous section for taking the thread dumps. Let us look at some of the other methods.

### Taking Thread Dump with Tools

1. **jstack**: `Jstack` is part of JDK since Java 5 and is widely used for taking thread dumps. We take thread dump with `jstack` with the below command:
```shell
sudo su java-service jstack -l <pid>
```
Using the -l option, we can include in the output, ownable synchronizers in the heap, and locks. However, with the release of JDK 8, Oracle suggests using it for taking thread dumps instead of the `jstack` for enhanced diagnostics and reduced performance overhead.

2. **VisualVM**: VisualVM is a graphical user interface(GUI) tool that provides detailed runtime information about the Java application. We use this runtime information to monitor, troubleshoot, and profile those applications. It has the additional capability to capture thread dumps from the java processes running in a remote host. From Java 9 onwards, VisualVM is distributed separately from JDK and can be downloaded from the [project's website](https://visualvm.github.io/).

3. **Jmc**: Java Mission Control (JMC) is also a GUI tool to collect and analyze data from Java applications. Like Visual VM, this can also connect to remote Java processes to capture thread dump.

4. **OS Utilities**: We can use the commands `kill -3 <pid>` in Unix and `ctrl+break` or `ctrl+<break key equivalent>` in windows to generate thread dump in the console where our java program is running. The Java process prints the thread dump on the standard output on receiving the signal.

5. **Application Performance Monitoring(APM) Tools**: Few APM tools provide options to generate thread dumps. For example, [AppDynamics](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO21/Diagnostic+Actions) provides this capability as part of its diagnostic actions, by directing the Java Agent to take a thread dump for a specified number of samples with each sample lasting for a specified number of milliseconds. The thread dump is executed on the node monitored by the agent. 

### Taking Thread Dump Programmatically with JMX
[ThreadMXBean](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.management/java/lang/management/ThreadMXBean.html) is the management interface for the thread system in the Java Virtual Machine. A sample program to generate thread dump is given here: 

```java
public class ThreadMXBeanSample {
  private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(ThreadMXBeanSample.class.getName());

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    startThreads();
    ThreadMXBean threadMxBean = ManagementFactory.getThreadMXBean();
    for (ThreadInfo ti : threadMxBean.dumpAllThreads(true, true)) {

      logger.info(ti.toString());
    }

 ...
 ...
    logger.info("Total number of threads created and started : " + threadMxBean.getTotalStartedThreadCount());
  }

  /**
   * Starts two threads thread1 and thread2 and calls their synchronized methods
   * in the run method resulting in a deadlock.
   */
  private static void startThreads() {
    final ThreadSample thread1 = new ThreadSample();
    final ThreadSample thread2 = new ThreadSample();
    Thread t1 = new Thread("Thread1") {
      public void run() {
        thread1.executeMethod1(thread2);
      }
    };

    Thread t2 = new Thread("Thread2") {
      @Override
      public void run() {
        thread2.executeMethod2(thread1);
      }
    };

    t1.start();
    t2.start();
  }
}

```
In this snippet, the thread dump is generated by calling the `dumpAllThreads` method. Before that we start two threads , each invoking synchronized method on `ThreadSample` class to simulate a `BLOCKED` thread condition. A part of the output containing the thread dump is given here:

```shell
Apr 20, 2021 8:09:11 AM io.pratik.threadops.ThreadMXBeanSample main
INFO: "Thread1" prio=5 Id=14 BLOCKED on io.pratik.threadops.ThreadSample@5b6f7412 owned by "Thread2" Id=15
  at app//io.pratik.threadops.ThreadSample.executeMethod2(ThreadSample.java:22)
  -  blocked on io.pratik.threadops.ThreadSample@5b6f7412
  at app//io.pratik.threadops.ThreadSample.executeMethod1(ThreadSample.java:17)
  -  locked io.pratik.threadops.ThreadSample@34c45dca
  at app//io.pratik.threadops.ThreadMXBeanSample$1.run(ThreadMXBeanSample.java:43)


Apr 20, 2021 8:09:11 AM io.pratik.threadops.ThreadMXBeanSample main
INFO: "Thread2" prio=5 Id=15 BLOCKED on io.pratik.threadops.ThreadSample@34c45dca owned by "Thread1" Id=14
  at app//io.pratik.threadops.ThreadSample.executeMethod1(ThreadSample.java:16)
  -  blocked on io.pratik.threadops.ThreadSample@34c45dca
  at app//io.pratik.threadops.ThreadSample.executeMethod2(ThreadSample.java:23)
  -  locked io.pratik.threadops.ThreadSample@5b6f7412
  at app//io.pratik.threadops.ThreadMXBeanSample$2.run(ThreadMXBeanSample.java:50)

```
We can see the two threads `Thread1` and `Thread2` in the `BLOCKED` state. If we follow the stack trace of `Thread1`, `ThreadSample` object is `locked` at method `executeMethod1` and `blocked` at `executeMethod2`.

## Analyzing Thread Dumps
fastThread](https://fastthread.io/) is one of the available tools for analyzing thread dumps.

Let us upload our thread dump file generated from a Kafka broker to the fastThread tool. FastThread generates a report from the thread dump which is much easier to understand compared to the raw file. Let us look at some of the useful sections of the report:

3. **Threads with identical stack trace**: This section of the report shows information when several threads in a thread dump working on one single method. This is indicative of resource contention on external resources like databases or APIs or infinite loops. That particular method needs to be analyzed to find the root cause.
4. **Most used methods**: By taking multiple consecutive thread dumps in a sequence, we can get an overview of the parts of our Java application that are used the most. 

5. **CPU consuming threads**: The report lists all threads which need to be analyzed for high CPU consumption.
6. **Blocking threads**: Blocking threads that are responsible for making an application unresponsive are listed under this section.
7. **Deadlocks**: This section contains threads that are causing a deadlock. The deadlock section of the previous example is shown here:
![Deadlock section](/assets/img/posts/thread-dump-analysis/fastthread-deadlock.png)
8. **Exceptions**: Thread dumps contain Exceptions and Errors in the thread's stack trace. These should be investigated to look for the root cause of a problem. 
9. **Flame graph**: Flame Graph condenses all the information from the thread dump into one single compact flame graph format. It helps to identify hot code paths for effective debugging/troubleshooting.


[IBM TDMA](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-thread-and-monitor-dump-analyzer-java-tmda), [samurai](https://github.com/yusuke/samurai), and 
[Spotify's thread dump analyzer](https://spotify.github.io/threaddump-analyzer/) are some of the other tools for analyzing thread dumps.

Manual analysis of raw thread dump files is always an option but is often tedious and time-consuming due to its verbose nature. Irrespective of the method used to analyze thread dumps, the results of the analysis can be used to diagnose a wide range of problems common in live systems.


## Conclusion

In this post, we looked at the five states of a java thread during its lifecycle and described thread dumps as a snapshot of thread states at a particular instant. We then ran a simple java application to simulate a web server and took its thread dump with the `jcmd` tool. After that, we introduced tools to analyze thread dumps and ended with some use cases and best practices of using thread dumps. A thread dump is often used in combination with [heap dump](https://reflectoring.io/create-analyze-heapdump/) and GC logs to diagnose java applications. I hope this will enable you to use thread dumps for the use cases described here and also find other areas where it can be put to use like automation with Ci/CD.
